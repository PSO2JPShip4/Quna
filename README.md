# WeebBot-v2
Discord bot used for alerting on Emergency Quests on Phantasy Star Online 2

Hey there, this is Weeb Bot, a Discord bot who's main functionality is to alert for Emergency Quests that happen on Phantasy Star Online 2. Previously on Python, it was rewritten on Javascript (using Discord.JS) for better performance.

## How to use

If you simply wish to have the bot on your server, just [click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=316634820908154880&scope=bot&permissions=0) and use the `+alerts` command to enable the EQ alerts.

## Dependencies

If you want to re-host the bot, you'll need to edit the `config.json` file with your bot's token, and install the following dependencies:

- (npm install) `request`
- (npm install) `discord.js`
- (npm install) `discord.js-commando`

Alternatively, you can `cd` to the bot's directory and run `npm install` to let npm take care of that for you.
